# 👋 Hi, I'm Amy Liu

I'm a multidisciplinary data analyst with a strong foundation in finance, IT, and big data technologies.

🧠 I enjoy transforming raw data into actionable insights, developing automated workflows, and crafting interactive dashboards that support decision-making. My work bridges technical execution with business context, and I'm especially interested in how AI and automation can streamline real-world operations.

🔧 **Tech I Use**:  
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask) · SQL · Power BI · Excel · DAX · Git · GCP · R

🚀 **Projects I'm Proud Of**:  
- Built an internal chatbot with DeepSeek LLM + RAG architecture to automate IT support (85%+ accuracy)  
- Designed a Power BI revenue dashboard used by executive teams across multiple global regions  
- Automated 120K-row financial reports using Python, reducing time from minutes to seconds

🌱 I'm currently exploring:  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Generative AI in enterprise tools  
- DataOps and scalable data pipelines
